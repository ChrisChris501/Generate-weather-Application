Simple Weather App using OpenWeatherMap API

This is a beginner-friendly weather application that allows users to search for real-time weather information by entering a city name. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current temperature and weather conditions.

Features:
- City-based weather search
- Real-time temperature and condition display
- Clean and minimal UI
- Built using JavaScript, Axios, and the OpenWeatherMap API

How It Works:
1. User enters a city name into an input field.
2. The app makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap using Axios.
3. It displays the temperature and weather condition in Â°C.

This was a great way to practice working with APIs, handling async requests, and dynamically updating the DOM.
